1. Optimize authentication flow:
    - Consider moving the session check to a client-side action after the initial page renders
    - Implement a loading state while authentication is being verified

2. A production build:
    - Run npm run build followed by npm run start to see how the site performs in production mode
    - This will give you a more accurate assessment of actual load times
