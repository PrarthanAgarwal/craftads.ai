# Credit System Implementation

This document summarizes the credit system implementation for the CraftAds application.

## Overview

The credit system enables users to:
1. View their current credit balance
2. Purchase credit packages
3. Use credits for image generations
4. View their credit transaction history

## Components Implemented

### 1. Database Schema

Created the database schema for:
- Users table with credit balance
- Credit packages table
- Credit transactions table
- Payments table
- Generation history table

### 2. Supabase Integration

- Configured the Supabase client with typed queries
- Added transaction support functions
- Implemented database helper functions for common operations

### 3. API Endpoints

Implemented the following API endpoints:

#### Credit Balance
```
GET /api/credits/balance
```
Returns the user's current credit balance.

#### Credit History
```
GET /api/credits/history
```
Returns the user's credit transaction history with pagination.

#### Credit Packages
```
GET /api/credits/packages
```
Returns all available credit packages for purchase.

#### Purchase Credits
```
POST /api/credits/purchase
```
Initiates a credit purchase transaction.

#### Complete Purchase
```
POST /api/credits/purchase/complete
```
Completes a credit purchase transaction.

### 4. Transaction Management

Implemented atomic operations for:
- Adding credits to a user's account
- Deducting credits when used for generations
- Recording all credit transactions

### 5. Mock Payment Processing

For demonstration purposes, created a mock payment flow:
```
GET /api/mock-payment
```
Simulates a payment process that would normally be handled by a third-party payment provider.

## Credit System Rules

1. Each new user receives 10 free credits upon registration
2. Credit packages are available in three tiers:
   - Starter: 50 credits for $19.99
   - Pro: 200 credits for $69.99
   - Business: 500 credits for $149.99
3. Each image generation consumes 1 credit
4. 1 credit = 1 generation

## Security Considerations

- Row-level security ensuring users can only access their own data
- Server-side validation for all credit operations
- Atomic transactions to maintain data consistency
- Admin client for sensitive operations

## Next Steps

1. **Implement Payment Provider Integration**:
   - Integrate with Stripe or another payment processor
   - Replace the mock payment flow with real payment processing

2. **Add Admin Tools**:
   - Create admin dashboard for managing credits
   - Implement tools for manual credit adjustments

3. **Enhance User Experience**:
   - Add credit balance display in UI
   - Implement low-credit warnings
   - Create receipt generation for purchases

4. **Expand Metrics and Analytics**:
   - Track credit usage patterns
   - Implement credit consumption reports

## Testing

The credit system can be tested by:
1. Creating a user account (automatically gets 10 free credits)
2. Viewing the credit balance via the API
3. Purchasing a credit package using the mock payment flow
4. Checking that the credit balance increases correctly
5. Implementing a generation feature that consumes credits
6. Verifying that the credit balance decreases correctly
